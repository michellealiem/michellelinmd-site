# Portfolio Website Changelog

## Session: December 26, 2025

### Hero Section Refinements
- **Avatar size:** Increased from `size-28` (112px) to `size-32` (128px) — more presence without crowding headline
- **Headline font:** Added **Bricolage Grotesque** as display font for "Dr. Michelle Lin" — distinctive, creative personality
  - Tested: Instrument Sans (refined), DM Sans (warm), Plus Jakarta Sans (geometric), Outfit (clean)
  - Chose Bricolage for "approachable innovator" vibe that matches "AI tinkerer always"
- **"AI tinkerer always" text:** Reduced from `text-xl` to `text-lg` — better visual hierarchy, width closer to "Educator by day"
- **Spacing:** Tightened `space-y-1.5` to `space-y-1` between headline and taglines

### Technical
- Added `font-display` Tailwind utility class mapped to `--font-display` CSS variable
- Bricolage Grotesque loaded via `next/font/google` with weights 400-800

## Session: December 25, 2025 (Late Night)

### Layout Overhaul
- **Removed Education section** — credentials are assumed for a UCSF Professor; CV material not portfolio material
- **Reordered sections:** Hero → About → Work Experience → Projects → Currently Exploring → Publications → Skills → Contact
- **Work Experience redesigned** — changed from stacked cards to compact 2x2 grid
  - Tested 3 options: A (2x2 grid), B (inline logo bar), C (collapsible accordion)
  - Chose Option A for balance of info density and visual appeal
  - Reordered card content: Company → Dates → Title (dates now apply to tenure, not rank)

### UCSF Entry Corrected
- Start date: 2004 → **2001** (when Michelle joined as Clinical Instructor)
- Description updated: "Faculty since 2001. Professor since 2015."
- Avoids misleading implication of being Professor for 24 years

### Project Logos Completed
- **DIL logo.jpg** — Digital Innovation Lab card
- **Dynamed logo.jpg** — DynaMed Editor card  
- **aliemu logo cropped.jpg** — ALiEMU card
- All 6 project cards now have proper logos

### Bug Fix
- Corrected previous session's date from "December 26" to "December 25" (UTC vs PST issue)
- Added user preference for Pacific timezone to prevent future date errors

### Still TODO
- [ ] Update avatar image (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Update Contact section text
- [ ] Populate full paper lists in expandable publication cards
- [ ] Review mobile responsiveness and dark mode
- [ ] Deploy to production
