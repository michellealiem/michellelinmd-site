# Portfolio Website Changelog

## Session: December 26, 2025 (Afternoon)

### Deployment to Production 🎉
- **GitHub repo created:** `michellealiem/michellelinmd-site`
- **Deployed to Netlify** — auto-deploys on push to main
- **Custom domain configured:** `michellelinmd.com` via Cloudflare DNS
- **SSL certificate:** Provisioning via Let's Encrypt (awaiting DNS propagation)

### Publications — Full Paper Lists Added
- Populated all 72 peer-reviewed publications across 6 themed cards
- Removed 7th theme (Clinical Research & Case Reports) — moved relevant papers to Digital Scholarship
- Removed paper count from section header ("72 peer-reviewed publications" → "Peer-reviewed publications organized by theme")
- Updated PublicationCard: shows 2 papers by default, expands to full list with max-height scroll

### Animations Added
1. **Scroll-triggered animations** — sections fade/blur in as user scrolls (`inView={true}` on BlurFade)
2. **Card hover lifts** — `hover:scale-[1.02]` on Work, Projects, Exploring, Publication cards
3. **Smooth link underlines** — animated underline effect on publication paper links (`.link-underline` CSS class)
4. **Animated gradient background** — subtle cyan-blue gradient shift behind hero section (15s animation cycle)

### Mobile Responsiveness Fixes
- Hero name: `text-3xl` → `text-2xl` on mobile (prevents line wrap on iPhone 12 Pro)
- Work Experience grid: `grid-cols-2` → `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` (single column on phones)

### Visual Hierarchy
- Section headers reduced from `sm:text-5xl` → `sm:text-4xl` (hero name stays dominant)
- Removed trailing periods from section subheaders

### Contact Form
- Embedded Netlify Forms contact form (Name, Email, Message)
- Created `public/form.html` for Netlify form detection (Next.js App Router workaround)
- Honeypot spam protection (`bot-field`)

### Social Links Updated
- LinkedIn: `michellelinmd` → `michelle-lin-md`
- X/Twitter: `MichelleLinMD` → `M_Lin`
- Instagram: Added new icon and link to `MichelleLinMD`
- Email nav icon: Now scrolls to `#contact` section instead of `mailto:`

### Section Header Renamed
- "AI Research" → "AI Lab" (better fits operational tools + research projects)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript error in `blur-fade.tsx` (`margin` type assertion for Netlify build)

## Session: December 26, 2025 (Morning)

### Hero Section Refinements
- **Avatar size:** Increased from `size-28` (112px) to `size-32` (128px) — more presence without crowding headline
- **Headline font:** Added **Bricolage Grotesque** as display font for "Dr. Michelle Lin" — distinctive, creative personality
  - Tested: Instrument Sans (refined), DM Sans (warm), Plus Jakarta Sans (geometric), Outfit (clean)
  - Chose Bricolage for "approachable innovator" vibe that matches "AI tinkerer always"
- **"AI tinkerer always" text:** Reduced from `text-xl` to `text-lg` — better visual hierarchy, width closer to "Educator by day"
- **Spacing:** Tightened `space-y-1.5` to `space-y-1` between headline and taglines

### Technical
- Added `font-display` Tailwind utility class mapped to `--font-display` CSS variable
- Bricolage Grotesque loaded via `next/font/google` with weights 400-800

## Session: December 25, 2025 (Late Night)

### Layout Overhaul
- **Removed Education section** — credentials are assumed for a UCSF Professor; CV material not portfolio material
- **Reordered sections:** Hero → About → Work Experience → Projects → Currently Exploring → Publications → Skills → Contact
- **Work Experience redesigned** — changed from stacked cards to compact 2x2 grid
  - Tested 3 options: A (2x2 grid), B (inline logo bar), C (collapsible accordion)
  - Chose Option A for balance of info density and visual appeal
  - Reordered card content: Company → Dates → Title (dates now apply to tenure, not rank)

### UCSF Entry Corrected
- Start date: 2004 → **2001** (when Michelle joined as Clinical Instructor)
- Description updated: "Faculty since 2001. Professor since 2015."
- Avoids misleading implication of being Professor for 24 years

### Project Logos Completed
- **DIL logo.jpg** — Digital Innovation Lab card
- **Dynamed logo.jpg** — DynaMed Editor card  
- **aliemu logo cropped.jpg** — ALiEMU card
- All 6 project cards now have proper logos

### Bug Fix
- Corrected previous session's date from "December 26" to "December 25" (UTC vs PST issue)
- Added user preference for Pacific timezone to prevent future date errors

### Still TODO
- [ ] Update avatar image (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Update Contact section text
- [ ] Populate full paper lists in expandable publication cards
- [ ] Review mobile responsiveness and dark mode
